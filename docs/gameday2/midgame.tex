Our original strategy did not work out for us very well.  We were expecting
a much faster paced announcement/bidding procedure, as well as a larger
number of subtasks required per task.  With that in mind, we have decided
to change our strategy.

\section{Announcement Strategy}

Instead of posting a large number of short-lived announcements.  We plan on
consolidating all of the subtasks we need to complete our tasks into one
announcement, and let it run for the duration of the round, leaving a little
time at the end to accept the best bids.  Our hope is that, even though the
cost of placing announcements will have increased due to this being our
high-cost phase, we will be able buy subtasks more efficiently.

In addition, we need to announce a higher price in order to attract more bids.
In the last few rounds we started at the Cost we were given, assuming it was
the ``market value''.  This generally did not work, and we were forced to
re-announce a large number of subtasks at a higher price.

\section{Bidding Strategy}

Given the change in our announcement strategy, we now have more time to
concentrate on making bids in order to sell our extra subtasks.  In order
to do this, we need to keep a close eye on the announcements as they are
made, bidding when appropriate.
