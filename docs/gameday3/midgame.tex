\maketitle

Our basic strategy has not changed.  Whenever we find one of our own items,
we pick it up.  If we find an item belonging to another team, we call it in
to be posted on the blackboard.

What has changed is how we plan to communicate.  Instead of placing a new call
each time we need to communicate, we are going to leave the line open the
entire period to cut down the overhead time of placing a call.
