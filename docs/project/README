CSE475 Project
Team Win: Ben Chavet, Steve Mott, Justin McKinstry

cse475-teamwin.zip contains the NetBeans project directory for our project.
inferno.zip contains our binary executable (and libraries) for our project.

To run the binary:
unzip inferno.zip
cd inferno
java -jar inferno.jar

The simulation environment is fairly straightforward.  It is an L x L grid of
spaces that have a flamability value and a fuel level.  On the simulation
setup, a specified number of these spaces is started on fire, and a specified
number of firefighters are randomly placed in the environment.

The goal is for the firefighters to put out the fire(s) without dying.  The
simulation will run until all fires are gone, either by being extinguished by
a firefighter, or by naturally burning out.  After the simulation, a number
of useful statistics are printed to stdout.  These statistics include how many
firefighters survived, the starting and ending state of the total amount of
health distributed amongst the firegithers, and the starting and ending state
of the total amount of fuel in the environment.

We did not track the number of messages posted / read from our blackboard.
