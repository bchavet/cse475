Firefighter Agents and Fire Agents:

* 2-dimensional grid for locations
* arbitrarily complicated: fire measures its neighbors and spreads faster when
  it has many neighbors.
* A firefighter dies if exposed to heat too long, have fire fighters spray
  "hot" firefighters to cool them off
* If a firefighter dies, the firefighters directly adjacent to him are not
  as effective.
* The longer two firefighters are stationed next to eachother, the stronger
  their bond, and the more significant the loss of effectiveness is if one
  of them dies

Firefighter Variables:

* Location (x,y)
* Age
* Heat felt
* Danger of burning
* Effectiveness

Fire Variables:

* Location (x,y)
* Age
* Probability of spreading (bell-curve wrt age)
* Probability of spreading (bell-curve wrt age)

Firefighter agents can move at will by asking their neighbors how much heat
they feel and move towards the hottest one.

To put out a fire, a firefighter must be adjacent to it.

To spread, the % chance increases with more adjacent fire.

During a tick, either do all firefighters then fires, or interleave them.
* One tick for firefighter = move, spray fire, spray firefighter, die
* One tick for fire = go out, get stronger, spread

Environment:

* Each square in the environment can have a variable "combustability" value,
  where a fire is more likely to spread to a square with higher
  combustability.
